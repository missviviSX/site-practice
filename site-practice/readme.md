this is a fun little set of practices I'm making 
to help learn HTML & CSS, and eventually JS better.
the idea is that they're all fandom related - websites 
modeled to be in-universe landing pages.

I'm not making any money from these. they're shared here 
to show how my skills are evolving,
but they're also saved to help me learn github.
